Libre Baskerville Fonts
======================

Libre Baskerville is a web font optimized for body text (typically 16px.)
It is based on the American Type Founder's Baskerville from 1941, but it has a taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast, that allow it to work well for reading on-screen.
